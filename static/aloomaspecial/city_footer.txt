                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px; font-size: larger; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:medium;"> Our business is very image-conscious. Are your dumpsters clean and presentable?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We understand that brand image is paramount. We pride ourselves on having one of the best-maintained fleets in the industry. Our roll off containers are regularly serviced and painted to ensure they present a clean, professional appearance on your commercial property.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">We need to do our renovation after hours. Can you accommodate nighttime or weekend service?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Yes. We specialize in working with commercial clients whose operations cannot be disrupted. We will work with you to schedule discreet, after-hours or weekend delivery and pickup times that align with your projectâ€™s schedule.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">What do we do about old computers, printers, and other e-waste from our office cleanout?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">While you can toss some electronics into the dumpster, we strongly encourage a more environmentally conscious approach. We recommend partnering with a dedicated e-waste recycling company for large quantities of computers and monitors. The dumpster is best used for furniture, fixtures, and general debris.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">Our restaurant is getting rid of old ovens and prep tables. Can they go in the dumpster?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Absolutely. Heavy stainless steel equipment, ovens, and tables can be loaded into our dumpsters. The only exception is for equipment with refrigerants, like walk-in freezers or refrigerators, which must be professionally drained of Freon before disposal.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma" style="font-size:large;">How do we ensure the dumpster rental doesn't disrupt other businesses in our plaza or office park?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Communication is key. We will work with you and your property manager to identify the least disruptive placement for the roll off rental, typically in a designated loading zone or service alley. Our professional drivers are trained to operate quickly and quietly to minimize any impact on your neighbors.</p>
